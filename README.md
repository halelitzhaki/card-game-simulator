# Card Game Simulator

This project is a C++ implementation of a card game simulator in CLI, featuring classes for players, cards, and game mechanics. It includes a demonstration of gameplay to showcase the interactions between these components.

## Features

- **Player Class**: Represents a player in the game, managing attributes such as name, hand, and score.
- **Card Class**: Models individual playing cards with suits and ranks.
- **Game Class**: Manages the overall game flow, including dealing cards, playing turns, and determining the winner.
- **Demo**: Provides a sample game scenario to demonstrate the functionality of the classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/halelitzhaki/CardGameSimulator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd card-game-simulator
   ```
3. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will generate an executable named `card_game_simulator`.

### Running the Demo

Execute the compiled program:
```bash
./card_game_simulator
```
The demo will simulate a game between two players, displaying the progress and outcome in the console.
